# Healthcare-Industry Capstone Project

DESCRIPTION

The dataset used in this experiment came from NIDDK. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts research to learn more about and develop therapies for the most chronic, costly, and devastating diseases. The goal is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes using diagnostic parameters from the dataset. Create a model that can accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes. Description of the Dataset The datasets include various medical predictor factors as well as one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables include the patient's number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and other factors. Variables Pregnancy Description Glucose levels during pregnancy An oral glucose tolerance test measures plasma glucose levels. BloodPressure Blood pressure during diastole (mm Hg) SkinThickness Skinfold thickness of the triceps (mm) Insulin Serum insulin levels after two hours BMI BMI (Body Mass Index) Diabetes PedigreeFunction Diabetes gene function Age Age in years Result Variable class (either 0 or 1). 268 of the 768 values are 1, while the rest are 0.
